## Simple .data kernel hook library
## Including
If you want to use this library in your kernel project then include "DataHook.h".

## Examples
If you want to see an example of how to use this library to make hooks/call them open the:
-  "ExampleUM.cpp" to see examples of how to call the hook from the usermode.
-  "ExampleKM.cpp" to see examples of how to use the DataHook.h library to set hooks.

## Detection
This project ***WILL*** get you banned on most games with popular anticheats (BE, EAC, etc),
but it may work for more simple games that have semi-advanced anticheats.
